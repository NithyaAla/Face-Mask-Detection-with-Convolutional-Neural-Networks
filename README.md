# Face-Mask-Detection-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
Face mask is a critical public health tool. Research shows that face masks help slow the spread of coronavirus disease.

This Face Mask Detection model was developed as a part of the capstone project of my bachelor’s degree at Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University.
The ML model detects whether a person is wearing a face mask or not from a live streaming video input. Tensorflow’s MobileNetV2 architecture has been used to design the model. MobileNets are a class of small, low-latency, low-power models that can be used for classification and detection.

The model’s high accuracy and speed, low latency, and compatibility with most of the IP cameras available in public places make it one of the best solutions to monitor whether people are following the government guidelines and wearing face masks or not.
